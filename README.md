Classification Model


The following study has been conducted to develop a machine learning predictive model for Techscape, 
a Portuguese startup that specialises in digital detox products sold through their online shop. The goal 
is to analyse the online behaviour of their customers and to predict which customers are more likely of 
buying their products depending on their online behaviour.
Envisioning to obtain the highest possible score on our test dataset, the project started with a detailed
data exploration and pre-processing, including checking for missing values and outliers, coherence 
checks, feature engineering and feature selection. Afterwards, a range of supervised learning 
algorithms were implemented such as, logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, support 
vector machines and ensemble techniques. The scores of each of these models were tested through 
validation datasets and the results across models were compared. To improve the performance of the 
models, we have tried different combinations by adjusting parameters, scaling the data, using different 
techniques for imbalanced datasets and outlier detection methods. Finally, the best model performance 
was obtained through Random Forest with a train score of 0.835, a validation score of 0.712 and a test 
score of 0.7159.
